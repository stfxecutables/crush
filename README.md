### What is this repository for? ###

It basically does this at the moment:
* Iterate the patient samples and each patient visit.
* Where it looks like something is incomplete, complete that part of the workflow above, otherwise skip â€“ I know my tests for readiness are incomplete here
* Take some measurements once completed

### How do I get set up? ###
